# Terraform for Azure
# Will initialize the backend statefile with the storage account to store
# Create a VM, Pub IP, Nic, Security Group, Disk and Disk Attachment

ToDo: 
1. Initialize the backend and store inside Azure Cosmos DB instead of Storage Account. 
    * This will allow versioning and encryption
